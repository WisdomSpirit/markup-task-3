            <span class="first-letter">T</span>hey called him &laquo;fat boy&raquo;,
            this seventeen-year
            old apprentice in&nbsp;the studio of&nbsp;Florentine painter
        </p>
        <p>
            Verrocchio who would receive care packages from his step-father, a&nbsp;pastry chef.
            The bastard son of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Florentine notary and a&nbsp;lady of&nbsp;Vinci, the
            boy&rsquo;s doting
            step-father gave him a&nbsp;taste for marzipans and sugars from a&nbsp;very young age.
        </p>
        <p>
            After three years as&nbsp;an&nbsp;apprentice, twenty-year old Leonardo took a&nbsp;job
            as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cook at
            the Tavern of&nbsp;the Three Snails near the Ponte Vecchio, working during the day
            on&nbsp;the
            few commissions his master sent his way and slinging polenta in&nbsp;the evenings.
            Polenta was the restaurant&rsquo;s signature dish, a&nbsp;tasteless hash of&nbsp;meats
            and corn porridge.
            When in&nbsp;the spring of&nbsp;1473, a&nbsp;poisoning sickened and killed the majority
            of&nbsp;the cooking
            staff of&nbsp;the tavern, Leonardo was put in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;the kitchen. He
            changed the menu
            completely, serving up&nbsp;delicate portions of&nbsp;carved polenta arranged
            beautifully
            on&nbsp;the plate. However, like most tavern clientele, the patrons preferred
            their
            meals in&nbsp;huge messy portions. Upset with the change in&nbsp;management,
            they ran Leonardo out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;job.
        </p>
        <p>
            He&nbsp;wrote a&nbsp;humble letter to&nbsp;Ludovico Sforza, the future Duke
            of&nbsp;Milan, by&nbsp;way
            of&nbsp;a&nbsp;job application:
        </p>
        <blockquote>&laquo;My&nbsp;painting and
            my&nbsp;sculpture will stand comparison with
            that of&nbsp;any other artist. I&nbsp;am supreme at&nbsp;telling riddles
            and tying knots.
            And I&nbsp;make cakes that are without compare.&raquo;
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Sforza took him on&nbsp;neither as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cook, painter, or&nbsp;sculptor,
            but instead as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lute
            player and after-dinner entertainer. Leonardo attempted to&nbsp;show his lord
            his new
            inventions for fortifications, catapults, and ladders, but Sforza paid little
            attention until the lute-player fashioned his inventions out of&nbsp;marzipan
            and jelly.
            Sforza charged the young man with refurbishing his kitchen, a&nbsp;task which
            would consume the life of&nbsp;Leonardo and the entire Sforza court.
        </p>
        <p>
            Five hundred years before modern cooking books, The Kitchen Notebooks of
            Leonardo da
            Vinci envisioned a&nbsp;culinary world as&nbsp;studio and laboratory, where food
            was to&nbsp;be
            prepared efficiently, beautifully, and ingeniously. Unfortunately, Italian food
            of&nbsp;the late fifteenth century had less to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the luxurious
            feats of&nbsp;Ancient Rome
            and more to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the rustic tastes of&nbsp;the Goths, whose dishes
            included meats
            and birds for those who could afford&nbsp;it, and an&nbsp;endless parade
            of&nbsp;porridge and gruel
            for those who could not. Leonardo was horrified by&nbsp;much of&nbsp;the food that
            was served
            to&nbsp;him, both at&nbsp;court and at&nbsp;home, and he&nbsp;included in&nbsp;his
            notebooks a&nbsp;running list
            of&nbsp;dishes that he&nbsp;hated, but that his own servant insisted on&nbsp;serving
            him: jellied
            goat, hemp bread, inedible turnips, and eel balls&nbsp;&mdash; which he&nbsp;notes:
        </p>
        <blockquote>&laquo;this dish if&nbsp;eaten often can cause madness.&raquo;</blockquote>
        <p>
            Leonardo believed that every kitchen task could be&nbsp;mechanized&mdash;crushing
            garlic,
            pulling spaghetti, plucking ducks&mdash;but the machines Leonardo imagined were
            sometimes
            far more elaborate than the task required. His invention for a&nbsp;giant whisk
            twice the
            size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man involved an&nbsp;operator from within who was constantly
            in&nbsp;danger of&nbsp;being
            wisked into the sauce. Another model involved a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;three horses
            engaged in&nbsp;the
            task of&nbsp;crushing a&nbsp;nut. One machine was intended to&nbsp;be&nbsp;operated
            by&nbsp;bees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leonardo was also a&nbsp;master of&nbsp;dining etiquette. Bad behavior
            at&nbsp;table was
            common among the courtiers. So&nbsp;Leonardo had to&nbsp;remind them that
            a&nbsp;courtier:
        </p>
        <ul class="behavior-rules">
            <li>He&nbsp;should not place his head upon his plate to&nbsp;eat.</li>
            <li>Neither should he&nbsp;sit beneath the table for any length of&nbsp;time.</li>
            <li>He&nbsp;should not place unpleasing or&nbsp;half-chewed pieces of
                his own food upon
                his neighbor&rsquo;s plate without first asking him.</li>
            <li>He&nbsp;should not wipe his knife upon his neighbor&rsquo;s clothing.</li>
            <li>Nor use his knife to&nbsp;carve upon the table.</li>
            <li>He&nbsp;should not set loose birds upon the table.</li>
            <li>Not snakes nor beetles...</li>
            <li>And if&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;vomit then he&nbsp;leaves the table.</li>
            <li>Likewise if&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;urinate.</li>
        </ul>
        <section class="photo-with-vertical-text">
            <span class="vertical-text">Masterpiece</span>

        <p>
            Leonardo&rsquo;s notebooks also humorously reveal the hidden violence
            of&nbsp;the Sforza
            court. He&nbsp;included instructions for hiring a&nbsp;new taster after
            Sforza&rsquo;s dies
            from a&nbsp;poisoning (&laquo;the old taster has done his job too well&raquo;).
            What Leonardo
            didn&rsquo;t know at&nbsp;the time was that Sforza had his man killed in
            order to&nbsp;install
            an&nbsp;actual poisoner, hired to&nbsp;slowly kill his elder brother and assume
            the Dukedom.
            The possibility of&nbsp;an&nbsp;actual assassination was a&nbsp;real concern
            at&nbsp;the Sforza court,
            and Leonardo explained that there should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;refined protocol
            to&nbsp;the affair:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            &laquo;If&nbsp;there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;assassination planned for the meal, then
            it&nbsp;is&nbsp;seemliest that the
            assassin should be&nbsp;seated next to&nbsp;he&nbsp;who is&nbsp;to&nbsp;become
            the subject of&nbsp;his craft...
            as&nbsp;this will cause less interruption to&nbsp;the conversation if&nbsp;the
            action of&nbsp;the event
            is&nbsp;confined to&nbsp;one small area... After the corpse (and bloodstains
            if&nbsp;any) are removed
            by&nbsp;the serving persons, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;customary for the assassin also
            to&nbsp;withdraw from the
            table as&nbsp;this presence may sometimes be&nbsp;disturbing to&nbsp;the
            digestions of&nbsp;the persons
            who now find themselves seated next to&nbsp;him, and to&nbsp;this end
            a&nbsp;good host will always
            have a&nbsp;fresh guest, who has waited without, ready to&nbsp;join the
            table at&nbsp;this juncture.&raquo;

        <h2 class="article-title">Sagrada Familia, a&nbsp;Barcelona Masterpiece, and Scofflaw?</h2>
        <img src="merlin.jpg" alt="The Sagrada Familia basilica by Antoni Gaudí" class="merlin"
        title="Sagrada Familia, a&nbsp;Barcelona Masterpiece, and Scofflaw"
        width="400" height="300">
        <p>
            <span class="first-letter">T</span>he Sagrada Familia basilica in
            Barcelona has
            worldwide fame as&nbsp;an&nbsp;architectural treasure, the dreamlike
            masterpiece of&nbsp;the
            Catalan architect Antoni Gaud&iacute;, which draws millions of
            visitors a&nbsp;year though
            it&nbsp;is&nbsp;still under construction, 136 years after work began.
        </p>
        <p>
            What it&nbsp;has not had for more than a&nbsp;century, according to
            the city, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;valid
            building permit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sagrada Familia basilica has agreed to&nbsp;pay city authorities
            36&nbsp;million euros,
            or&nbsp;about $41&nbsp;million, over 10&nbsp;years to&nbsp;settle the
            dispute over the legality of
            the work and help pay for transportation improvements around the basilica.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the permit as&nbsp;leverage, the administration of&nbsp;Barcelona
            &rsquo;s far-left mayor,
            Ada Colau, took on&nbsp;the Sagrada Familia, part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;trend
            of&nbsp;civil authorities
            around the country challenging the legal and tax status of&nbsp;Roman
            Catholic Church
            properties. Ms. Colau hailed the agreement, announced on&nbsp;Thursday,
            as&nbsp;historic.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sagrada Familia&rsquo;s board had denied any wrongdoing, saying that
            it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;building
            permit&nbsp;&mdash; one issued in&nbsp;1885 by&nbsp;Sant Mart&iacute;
            de&nbsp;Proven&ccedil;als, which was an&nbsp;independent
            town at&nbsp;the time. Barcelona officials contend that after Sant
            Mart&iacute; was absorbed
            into the city several years later, the construction required a
            Barcelona permit;
            the board says that for more than a&nbsp;century, no&nbsp;one asked
            for any such thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Work began in&nbsp;1882&nbsp;on the Sagrada Familia, whose radical design,
            incorporating
            elements of&nbsp;Gothic revival, Art Nouveau, modernism and Asian art,
            has been
            compared to&nbsp;everything from a&nbsp;Dr. Seuss drawing to&nbsp;an
            underwater forest
            of&nbsp;kelp and coral.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gaud&iacute; died after being hit by&nbsp;a&nbsp;tram in&nbsp;1926,
            with the project only about
            one-quarter complete, and for decades after his death, progress was slow,
            sporadic and often intensely debated. But the pace of&nbsp;work picked
            up&nbsp;in
            recent years. The Sagrada Familia is&nbsp;over two-thirds completed, and
            planners hope to&nbsp;finish it&nbsp;in&nbsp;2026, in&nbsp;time for the
            centenary of
            Gaud&iacute;&rsquo;s death.
        </p>
        <p>
            Critics contend that the Sagrada Familia has drifted too far from the vision
            of&nbsp;Gaud&iacute;&nbsp;&mdash; some of&nbsp;his plans were destroyed long
            ago&nbsp;&mdash; or&nbsp;that it&nbsp;has more
            appeal as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the world&rsquo;s greatest unfinished monuments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even incomplete and surrounded by&nbsp;scaffolding and building cranes, Sagrada
            Familia is&nbsp;Barcelona&rsquo;s most famous monument, visited by&nbsp;over
            10,000 people
            a&nbsp;day and pictured on&nbsp;countless postcards and calendars. In
            November 2010,
            Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church as&nbsp;a&nbsp;basilica and held
            Mass there
            before 7,000&nbsp;people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ms. Colau and her administration accused the basilica&rsquo;s board of
            working without
            a&nbsp;building permit, failing to&nbsp;submit required plans to
            tear down existing
            residential structures to&nbsp;finish the Sagrada Familia&rsquo;s
            esplanade, and failing
            to&nbsp;pay construction taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city&rsquo;s complaints struck a&nbsp;nerve in&nbsp;a&nbsp;country
            where, over several decades,
            the church had quietly registered thousands of&nbsp;properties, including
            the famed
            cathedral-mosque C&oacute;rdoba, as&nbsp;tax-exempt, leading to&nbsp;claims
            of&nbsp;tax evasion and
            a&nbsp;debate over how the church spends tourism revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a&nbsp;Socialist prime minister, Pedro S&aacute;nchez, took power
            in&nbsp;June, his government
            announced that it&nbsp;would publish an&nbsp;inventory of&nbsp;all property
            claimed by&nbsp;the
            Catholic Church, opening the door to&nbsp;potential challenges to&nbsp;that
            ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ms. Colau faced pressure to&nbsp;resolve the conflict over the Sagrada Familia
            ahead of&nbsp;what is&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;uphill campaign
            for re-election next spring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the deal struck this week, city authorities will go&nbsp;ahead with
            transportation
            infrastructure work around Sagrada Familia, including a&nbsp;feasibility
            study to&nbsp;build
            a&nbsp;passageway linking the basilica directly to&nbsp;the closest subway
            station.
            The agreement did not settle the dispute over the planned seizure of
            nearby homes.
        </p>
        <p>But the basilica will, at&nbsp;last, have a&nbsp;building permit.</p>

            The interior of&nbsp;Casa Vicens has been restored to&nbsp;its original
            state based on&nbsp;archival research
        </span>
        <p>
            The house was a&nbsp;family home until 2014, when it&nbsp;was bought
            by&nbsp;the Andorran
            financial institution MoraBanc, which made plans to&nbsp;open it
            to&nbsp;the public.
